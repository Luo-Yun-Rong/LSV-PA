## 2020 Fall Logic Synthesis and Verification - Programming Assignment 2

### Implementation
#### Used API
 * I used `Abc_NtkCreateCone` to extract a single PO's circuit. The parameter `fUseAllCis` is set to 0 to exclude the non-relevant PIs.
 * I used `Cnf_Derive` to generate the clauses of "positive cofactor circuit" and `Cnf_DataWriteIntoSolver` to create a new SAT solver with these clauses. I used `Cnf_DataLift` to rename the variables so as to represent the clauses of "negative cofactor circuit" and use `sat_solver_addclause` to append these new clauses.
 * I used `sat_solver_addvar` to generate the variables that enables or disables PI-equivalence between the positive cofactor circuit and negative cofactor circuit.
 * I used `sat_solver_solv` to do incremental SAT solving. 
 
#### Data Structure
  
  * `vector<int> UnateVec`: I used a vector<int> of length = number of PIs in circuit to reprensent the unateness with respect to every Pi. There are four cases. I used 0 to represent both positive and negative unate, 1 to represent positvie unate, 2 to represent negative unate, and 3 to represent binate. Initially, every entry is set to 3. If we conclude that some PI is positive unate after SAT solving, the entry will do &=1. Similary, if we conclude that it is negative unate, the entry will do &=2. Therefore, if some PI is both positive and negative unate, it will become 0 eventually.
   
  * `vector<int> posCofPiVars`: I used a vector<int> of length = number of PIs to bookeep the variable number of PIs in the positive cofactor circuit in CNF. The entry is set flag if the PI is not in the cone of current PO. I didn't keep track of the variable number of PIs in the negative cofactor. I only record an integer `VarShift` between the positive and negative cofactor circuit.
 
  * `vector<int> ForceEqVars`: I used a vector<int> of length = number of PIs to bookeep the number of the variables that enables or disables PI-equivalence.
  * `lit * assumpList`: I used an array to store the assumption literals that will be pushed into SAT solver.
