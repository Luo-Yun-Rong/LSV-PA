### Implementation
  * Data Structure
    * UnateVec:
    I used a vector<int> of length = number of PI in circuit to reprensent the unateness with respect to every Pi. There are four cases. I used 0 to represent both positive and negative unate, 1 to represent positvie unate, 2 to represent negative unate, and 3 to represent binate. Initially, every entry is set to 3. If we conclude that some PI is positive unate after SAT solving, the entry will do &=1. Similary, if we conclude that it is negative unate, the entry will do &=2. Therefore, if some PI is both positive and negative unate, it will become 0 eventually.
