#### Data Structure:
  
  * `vector<int> UnateVec`: I used a vector<int> of length = number of PI in circuit to reprensent the unateness with respect to every Pi. There are four cases. I used 0 to represent both positive and negative unate, 1 to represent positvie unate, 2 to represent negative unate, and 3 to represent binate. Initially, every entry is set to 3. If we conclude that some PI is positive unate after SAT solving, the entry will do &=1. Similary, if we conclude that it is negative unate, the entry will do &=2. Therefore, if some PI is both positive and negative unate, it will become 0 eventually.
   
  * `vector<int> posCofPiVars`: I used a vector<int> of length = number of PI to record the variable number of PIs in positive cofactor circuit  in CNF. The entry is set to -2 if the PI is not in the cone of current PO. 
 
  * `vector<int> ForceEqVars`: For every PI , we add
